It shapes how users engage with a system and how the system responds to their actions.

A well-designed interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

It is the designer's responsibility to ensure that users can effortlessly understand how to interact with the system, and that the system behaves in ways that meet their expectations.

<span style="font-size: 28px;"> **Affordance** </span>

Affordance is the property of an object that allows an individual to know how to use it.

A good affordance is a desgin feature that clearly communicates the way an object is supposed to be used.

As an image is worth a thousand words, here is an example of a door handle that has a good affordance.

![3 doors with different handles](/hw1/1-DoorAffordances-768x423.png)

With those three handles the user can have a clear idea of how the door is working either he should push, pull or turn it.  
The left door has a handle that can be twisted, the middle door should be pulled and the right door should be pushed. 

Here are some example from my daily life that have good and bad affordance :

By seeing the tab, we don't know which way we need to turn it in order to have cold or hot water. That could be fixed by just adding red color for hot and a blue color for cold.

It is easy to know how does this coffee machine work. By clicking on left small cup, we know that we will have a small coffee and by clicking on the right big cup, we know thaht we will have a big coffee.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">**Gestalt's Law**</span>

The Gestalt Laws are principles of human perception that explain how we group similar elements, identify patterns, and simplify complex images when perceiving objects. Designers apply these principles to arrange content on websites and other interfaces to make them both visually appealing and easy to comprehend.

![Gestalt's Law](/hw1/gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-2795835-01-8f488f3d191048a0bc42e23ff9470042.png)

Let's explore the different laws according to the illustration : 

  * **Law of Similarity** : This law states that similar things tend to appear grouped together. 
  * **Law of Proximity** : Things that are closed together seem more related than things that are spaced. 
  * **Law of Continuity** : Elements in a line or curve seem more related to one another than those positioned randomly.
  * **Law of Closure** : We perceive elements as belonging to the same group if they seem to complete some entity.
  * **Law of Common Region** : When elements are located in the same closed region, we perceive them as belonging to the same group.
  * **Law of Prägnanz** : When you're presented with a set of ambiguous or complex objects, your brain will make them appear as simple as possible.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">**Dark Designs**</span>


Dark patterns, also known as deceptive design or deceptive patterns, are essentially tricks. Websites and apps use dark patterns to manipulate users into making decisions they wouldn’t have otherwise made—like subscribing to a service you won’t use, agreeing to marketing emails you didn’t want, or giving up your personal data. 

Businesses and consumers alike need to be aware of these patterns. Knowing how to recognize dark patterns means you’re far less likely to fall victim to one or to unintentionally introduce one in your own organization’s website or app. 

Let's see two examples of Dark designs and see how we could improve them : 

* **Confirm Shaming** : Everyone has ever experienced a cookie pop-up which was forcing and pleading with you to accept it, as if you don't accept it, the earth would stop turning ? That's confirm Shaming, in which the user os emotionally manipulated into perfofrming some action they wouldn't do otherwise. This could be solved by just making a small window which just notify something and which can be easily closed.

* **Nagging** : When you want to access to a website or a service, but everytime you navigate to a new page, you are asked for consentment to data processing. If it happened only one time, it would be ok, but at soon as the window pop up at everyu click it becomes nagging.
