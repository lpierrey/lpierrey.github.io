It shapes how users engage with a system and how the system responds to their actions.

A well-designed interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

It is the designer's responsibility to ensure that users can effortlessly understand how to interact with the system, and that the system behaves in ways that meet their expectations.

<span style="font-size: 28px;"> **Affordance** </span>

Affordance is the property of an object that allows an individual to know how to use it.

A good affordance is a desgin feature that clearly communicates the way an object is supposed to be used.

As an image is worth a thousand words, here is an example of a door handle that has a good affordance.

With those three handles the user can have a clear idea of how the door is working either he should push, pull or turn it.  
The left door has a handle that can be twisted, the middle door should be pulled and the right door should be pushed. 

Here are some example from my daily life that have good and bad affordance :

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">**Gestalt's Law**</span>

The Gestalt Laws are principles of human perception that explain how we group similar elements, identify patterns, and simplify complex images when perceiving objects. Designers apply these principles to arrange content on websites and other interfaces to make them both visually appealing and easy to comprehend.

Let's explore the different laws according to the illustration : 

  * **Law of Similarity** : This law states that similar things tend to appear grouped together. 
  * **Law of Proximity** : Things that are closed together seem more related than things that are spaced. 
  * **Law of Continuity** : Elements in a line or curve seem more related to one another than those positioned randomly.
  * **Law of Closure** : We perceive elements as belonging to the same group if they seem to complete some entity.
  * **Law of Common Region** : When elements are located in the same closed region, we perceive them as belonging to the same group.
  * **Law of Pr√§gnanz** : When you're presented with a set of ambiguous or complex objects, your brain will make them appear as simple as possible.
