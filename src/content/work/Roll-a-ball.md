  <span style="font-size: 32px;">Developping a Roll a ball game using Unity</span>
</blockquote>


During a HCI course, we had to develop a simple roll a ball game. 

The goal of the game is to gather all the green cubes. Each green cube give you one point and each yellow one give you -1 points. The goal is to achieve a score of 5 and there is 5 green cubes.

The game will be at the third person meaning that the camera will follow the rolling ball from above. 

Here is a short gameplay.
